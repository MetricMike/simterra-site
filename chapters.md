    <p>It is the 27th century and the world, as you knew it, is over.</p>

    <p>Amidst the ruins of the Old Dominion, new nations are born.
    Boxed in by vicious monsters, magical storms, and powerful foes,
    six nations of humans, elves, dwarves, and even stranger beings
    have managed to thrive despite the odds. Between those city-states 
    lies an unbroken expanse of wilderness which had remained untamed for 
    centuries until Pelagros was formed. A coalition of unlikely allies
    has taken root, barely a thousand strong, and formed a nexus of
    commerce, politics, and adventure. A courageous few arm themselves
    with sword, gun, spell, and wit to face the dangers in search of
    fame, fortune, glory, and knowledge. Are you brave enough to take
    your place among them?</p>

    <p>As the clamorous, beautiful, and boisterous Queen Sagasjón, the Queen of
    Thunder and Ice once said “Why do we sail? Freedom. Freedom from the chains
    of an over-reaching society. Freedom from the judgment of others, from
    responsibilities we never asked for, from the weight of our own fears.
    We Sail for the Freedom to write our own tales. Every person can take 
    up the mantle of 'captain' and build a crew for their family; and in
    this fleet, there is only one rule: ‘Don’t be an Asshole’. Break it at your peril…”</p>

    <p>The peoples of the Thundermark Isles are wild and rowdy, a town built on
    heaps of stolen plunder, and even taller piles of stories. None can match 
    the skill with which they navigate the treacherous waters of Holurheim, 
    belching thick clouds of black smoke as they hunt Whalesquid for their meat
    and oil. Or ensnare unwise seafaring travelers who stray into their waters.
    Nor their penchant for tall tales and lust for adventure! The Thundermark Isles
    are a crowded, obtrusive nation tolerated for its astounding ability to
    facilitate movement and trade across Holurheim along with their ability
    to combat the terrors that prowl the ocean.</p>
