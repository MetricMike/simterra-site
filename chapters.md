    <p>It is the 27th century and the world, as you knew it, is over.</p>
    <p>Amidst the ruins of the Old Dominion, new nations are born. Boxed in by vicious monsters, magical storms, and powerful foes, six nations of humans, elves, dwarves, and even stranger beings have managed to thrive despite the odds. Between those city-states  lies an unbroken expanse of wilderness which had remained untamed for  centuries until Pelagros was formed. A coalition of unlikely allies has taken root, barely a thousand strong, and formed a nexus of commerce, politics, and adventure. A courageous few arm themselves with sword, gun, spell, and wit to face the dangers in search of fame, fortune, glory, and knowledge. Are you brave enough to take your place among them?</p>

    <p>The citizens of Stonecropt live in a place which was once a settlement of Hellanese people who wished to expand territory out into the the wilds. Creating new farm lands for not only crops but for their ever growing population of Highlancoo, Stonecropt was built in a place where once the beautiful flowers of the same name reigned across fields and through the forests. Pushing ever further out, Hella eventually made a pact with the Wylde Wood and their people now live in harmony with the Fey whom have resided in those woodlands for so long. They have created a Council of go betweens which live within Stonecropt and speak with the Wylde Wood fey often, making sure that things stay within balance.</p>
    <p>Now there is a new force within Stonecropt as the Hrafnfolk have begun to move into the town there, changing the dynamics as everyone once knew it. Even Opal Court has been seen traveling from Hella Proper to come and visit the lands of Stonecropt. The delicate balance is beginning to fracture. Do they loyally follow their King and Queen, kneel to the Opal Court and serve the higher purpose for Hella as was originally designed along with Prince Calder and Lady Frikka? Or do they hold fast to the beliefs that have gotten them through these last few generations and continue to work closely with the Wylde Wood despite The Dryadâ€™s silence? Welcome to Stonecropt, a place as stable as the land of Fire and Ice itself.</p>
