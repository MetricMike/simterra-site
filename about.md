#### Intrigue, atmosphere, adventure and danger around the corner while camaraderie, laughter and enjoyment awaits you.

SimTerra is a fast paced boffer LARP set in an unforgiving, post-apocalyptic Earth 
reshaped by magic and monsters. Five centuries after a cataclysm destroyed 
civilization; humanity and it's descendants still struggle against dangers lurking 
just past their meager barriers.
 
Here, player skill is more important than character stats. Players can use weapons, 
armor, magic and firearms without restriction. Magic flows freely with unlimited 
casting and spells that every player can cast capable of elemental damage, healing 
and emotional manipulation. In SimTerra, a new character might not have as many 
tricks as one that's been around for years, but they can be just as deadly.
We encourage player creativity and initiative. Our world is one of base survival, 
layered politics and complex problem solving. Money, lore, favors and time can all 
be used to solve problems that strength of arms alone cannot, while professions and 
crafts offer income and increased player options.
 
We have multiple races with rich cultures, and for those new to our world or LARPing 
in general, we offer an easy starting point. Cryogens are people from before the 
apocalypse (1851-2005 CE) that have awakened to a very different world then the one 
they remember. Playing one allows you to dive right in and discover the world of 
SimTerra at the same time your character does.
