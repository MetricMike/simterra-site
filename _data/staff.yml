  about: "Drew, aka Game Master Matrix, is the spark and the face of SimTerra.
          Over 10 years ago he started this project with GM Sunflower and GM
          Nerf Bat. His drive for an easy system that anyone could jump in and
          play along with a desire to have something fun that compliments out
          of character skill drove him to create the SimTerra system. He also
          has a passion for playing monsters, creating complex creatures, and
          doning roles that showcase the world scope. Drew is the primary GM
          for our first Chapter SimTerra: Bastion. You will often find Drew
          out in the field battling PCs, creeping through corridors, or
          organizing the next set of NPCs to come out for the enjoyment
          of our players."
