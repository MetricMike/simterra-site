  about: "Drew, aka Game Master Matrix, is the spark and the face of SimTerra.
          Over 10 years ago he started this project with GM Sunflower and GM
          Nerf Bat. His drive for an easy system that anyone could jump in and
          play along with a desire to have something fun that compliments out
          of character skill drove him to create the SimTerra system. He also
          has a passion for playing monsters, creating complex creatures, and
          doning roles that showcase the world scope. Drew is the primary GM
          for our first Chapter SimTerra: Bastion. You will often find Drew
          out in the field battling PCs, creeping through corridors, or
          organizing the next set of NPCs to come out for the enjoyment
          of our players."

          who keeps track of the high arcane, mysteries, and in character
          atmosphere. From the start Micha was involved in the first iteration
          of magic and as our world grew she keeps the secrets of those dire
          high arcane pieces, creatures, and cultures. Micha also keeps track
          of which plot lines are run by what staff members so that if you
          have a question, she can often point you in the right direction of
          who to go to. Lastly, GM Sunflower is without a doubt our mistress
          of horror and runs the SimTerra: Aquia Chapter which is filled with
          monsters, mysteries, and scares around every corner. You will often

          both between events and on site. He is an integral and irreplacable part
          of our team. Not only is he the mind behind SimRep but he is also our

          NPC checks in with him, every staff member (even our 3 GMs) run things
          past him and all PCs know that if they need anything, they can check in and
          our Head Facilitator will have it covered. You will almost always find
          Michael sitting at the head of NPC shack on his super computer except for

          event along with new short term one offs. Luke focuses on the day to day
          roleplays that truly shows off that even though you have to do hero things
          to keep Bastion running, you also have to make sure everything else runs
          smoothly at the water mill. That those bandits that attacked the incoming
          caravan don't get away with the incoming crops. That there may be something
          strange and wonderful around the corner. You will often find Luke running
          around the campsite making sure that all our players, new and veteran, are
          enjoying their event."
